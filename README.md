The second page named About.py contains informtaion about the project I did during the data science course last semester.A screen shot of both pages has been uploaded above and three different commits. One was written during the coding of the dashboard, one during coding of About file and the last one after editing the README file.

## System description

### Installation of libraries
The libraries were installed and the environment created in VSCode before coding. I install the environemnt from the project folder using a new command in terminal.


### Execute custom Dashboard

Everytime I logg into  VSCode I make sure that you are running Python from the environment. TThe following code is used to run the custom dashboard:


> streamlit run Dashboard.py
# If the command above fails, use:
> python -m streamlit run Dashboard.py
```
