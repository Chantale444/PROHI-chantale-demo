### About this Project  

This is a brief summary of my data science project during the DSHI course.  
The course deepened my interest in machine learning and data science, and I had to burn the midnight oil!  

I conducted exploratory data analysis on the UCI Income dataset, downloaded from Kaggle.  
The dataset included features such as age, education level, and marital status. My main question was:  
_Is an individual's income correlated to these demographic factors?_  

I performed data preprocessing, visualization, and correlation analysis.  
Later, I explored predictive modeling to classify income levels using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest.  

The course concluded with a storytelling exercise, which was both challenging and rewarding.  
This project made me even more motivated to continue learning in the field of data science.
