### About this Project

This mini dashboard was created as part of the DSHI course. Last year, I took a data science course that inspired me to deepen my knowledge of the field and its applications in healthcare. The course was both interesting and challenging, and I worked hard because I could see its real-world applications.  

In the Introduction to Data Science course, I selected the "income" dataset from Kaggle and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Google Colab. This involved cleaning the data, renaming columns for clarity, and answering univariate and bivariate questions. I visualized the dataset using histograms and boxplots.  

Next, I created a synthetic dataset to explore classification algorithms, and conducted classification tasks using models like K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. The project concluded with a storytelling section, which I found exciting and motivating. This experience has made me eager to learn more about data science and its practical applications.
