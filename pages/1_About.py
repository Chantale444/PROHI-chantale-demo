### About â€“ Student Mental Health Analytics  

This mini-project focuses on **student mental health analytics**, highlighting the importance of exploring factors 
that can influence student well-being and academic performance. The goal is to **demonstrate predictive analytics 
using synthetic data**, ensuring privacy while simulating realistic academic and lifestyle patterns.  

The dashboard is designed to illustrate how basic **data science workflows** can be applied to a health informatics 
context. Users can interact with **filters** to adjust study hours, semesters, and stress levels, observing changes in 
synthetic indicators such as **CGPA, stress scores, and sleep hours**.  

To build this interactive application, tools like **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Scikit-learn** were 
used for data visualization, synthetic data generation, and layout design. This project demonstrates the integration 
of programming, analytics, and visualization techniques to create a user-friendly interface for understanding 
student mental health dynamics.
